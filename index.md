Hello and welcome to our development guidelines.

We share this with employees and freelancers when onboarding to ensure we keep a consistent code style through our projects.

A few notes:

- This isn't a bible, they really are more like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jl0hMfqNQ-g?autoplay=1" target="_blank">guidelines</a>, but at the end of the day we are just trying to keep things consistent.
- If there's anything you are unsure about please drop a message in in slack.
- If there's anything you'd like to improve upon, then please open a ticket or create a PR and we will all jump on it to review it. ðŸ˜Š
