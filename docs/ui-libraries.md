# UI Libraries

## Introduction

UI libraries are an essential tool for us to create user-friendly and visually appealing applications.

These libraries provide pre-written and tested components, such as buttons, drop-down menus, and modals, that can be easily integrated into our projects.

This reduces the time and effort required to build UI elements from scratch and ensures consistency across all projects.

Some libaries may fit a use case better than another.

> It's important to note that UI Libraries such as Material UI and Ant Design are popular and widely used, they may not be the best fit for a project as they usually have unique requirements and aesthetic, so they won't appear in this list.

## No-UI or Headless UI Component Libraries

Headless UI Libraries are a type of UI library that focus solely on providing the building blocks for UI components, without including any pre-designed styles or aesthetics.

These libraries provide a set of functional components that can be easily composed to create a custom user interface, but leave the styling and visual design up to the developer.

This allows for greater flexibility and customization, as well as the ability to match the look and feel of an existing design system.

Below you will find a list of UI Libraries we use and ❤️
